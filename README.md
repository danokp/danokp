### <h1 align="center">Hi thereðŸ‘‹</h1>

My name is Daniil Penkov.
I'm a Python developer. Currently, as part of an e-commerce company, I develop solutions that help people around the world receive their packages on time and without any issues.

Previously, I worked for over four years as a civil (geotechnical) engineer and now successfully implement the best engineering practices and approaches in a new field.

I love to dig into engineering problems and find their solutions using modern technologies if it's necessary.
